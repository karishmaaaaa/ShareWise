# Today I Learned (TIL) – Sharing Wall  
*A no-code web application for sharing daily learnings — built through research-driven tool selection, workflow design, and visual development.*

---

## 📘 Overview

**Today I Learned (TIL)** is a no-code web app where users can share something they learned each day — whether it’s a tech tip, life insight, or random fact.  
The platform supports tagging, liking, and saving posts, creating a lightweight social experience without writing traditional code.

This project emphasizes **research, system design, and no-code development**, focusing on how to architect functional applications through visual tools.

## 🔍 Research & Tool Evaluation

Before development, I conducted in-depth research to find the most suitable no-code environment for building a feature-rich social-style platform.

### Platforms Evaluated
- **Bubble**
- **Softr**
- **FlutterFlow**
- **Webflow**
- **Glide**

### Evaluation Criteria
- Database flexibility (relational structure support)  
- Built-in user authentication  
- Dynamic content rendering & real-time feed updates  
- Custom workflow logic  
- Responsive design capabilities  
- Plugin/integration ecosystem  
- Scalability and cost

### Final Decision
I selected **Bubble** (or replace with your tool) because it offered:
- A robust visual logic builder  
- A flexible built-in database  
- Native user authentication  
- High design freedom  
- Strong community support and plugins  

This decision was made based on research findings, feature comparison tables, and prototyping tests.

## 🧩 System Architecture (No-Code)

Although created without code, the project uses a structured architecture:

### **Database Models**
- **User** – profile, saved posts, liked posts  
- **Post** – content, author reference, timestamp  
- **Tag** – label, related posts  
- **Interactions** – likes and saves (linked to user & post)  

### **Key Workflows**
- Create post  
- Like/unlike a post  
- Save/remove saved post  
- Create and associate tags  
- Fetch posts by tag  
- Manage user authentication and sessions  

These workflows were built using visual logic blocks, acting as no-code equivalents to backend routes, state managers, and controllers.
